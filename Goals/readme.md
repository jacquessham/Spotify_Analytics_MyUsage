# Goals and Requirements
The goals are to develop the ETL pipeline to systematically store the listening records obtained from Spotify in a centralized data lake and use this backend to power the dashboards or machine learning infrastructure.
<br><br>
We have two main goals for this solution:
<ul>
	<li>Data saved in flatfiles partitioned by Month/year</li>
	<li>Interactive dashboard to analyze insights and trend</li>
</ul>

## Data Lake Requirement
<ul>
	<li>Able to identify users</li>
	<li>Store source data in flatfiles partitioned by Month/year</li>
	<li>A centralized relational database for analytics and machine learning</li>
</ul>
