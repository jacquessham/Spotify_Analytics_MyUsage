# Goals and Requirements
The goals are to develop the ETL pipeline to systematically store the listening records obtained from Spotify in a centralized data lake and use this backend to power the dashboards or machine learning infrastructure.
<br><br>
We have two main goals for this solution:
<ul>
	<li>Data saved in flatfiles partitioned by Month/year</li>
	<li>Interactive dashboard to analyze insights and trend</li>
</ul>

## Data Lake Requirement
Coming soon...

## Dashboard Requirement
KPI:
<ul>
	<li>Number of times played</li>
	<li>Total Played Time</li>
	<li>Average/Minimum/Maximum played time</li>
	<li>Number of Skipped songs</li>
	<li>More coming soon...</li>
</ul>
